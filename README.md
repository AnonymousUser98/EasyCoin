# EasyCoin
This is a fake website similar to Kitboga's _MyCoin_. Scambaiters can host this website and put a QR code to it on their fake Bitcoin ATM receipts.\
Fake CAPTCHAs are not included, but you can find some at [this repo](https://github.com/AnonymousUser98/CoFaCaFo-SB).

## The Long Setup Process
Scammers will need to do a lot of things:
* Create an account with their full name and email address
* Add a birthday, gender, and address to their account
* Add a credit card to their account
* Enter their crypto wallet address
* Add 3 security questions to their account

After all that, they'll finally get to the impossible CAPTCHAs.

## Notes & Credits
The user should start at `welcome.html`.\
I haven't added any code to actually collect the info entered into forms by the scammer.\
I used a template from TemplateMo to make this website.\
A few of the original files from the template are unused in this project.\
I haven't added any functionality to the _Add Funds_ button on the dashboard.

If you have any improvements, please fork this repo and take over the project.
